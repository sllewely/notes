# Docker

A *container* is a running *image*

```docker info```

```docker run ... --name name```

``` docker container stop name```

```docker container ls -a``` to see all, including exited containers

```docker container rm name```

```docker image ls```

```docker image rm image_name``` (container must be removed first)
