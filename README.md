### Your coding language check list

Pick just one language to practice and master for interviews -- don't get distracted by learning the easy beginnings of a new language.  Companies care that you are an expert in one language and can demonstrate it, not that you can code in their language.

  * loops - best practice with iterating over objects, also how to iterate over a list with both the index and element value
  * sort and sort_by
  * regex !! iterating over a string and finding matching patterns
  * recursion
  * dicts, maps, and data structures like queues
  * classes, constructors, class and object variables

  * Advanced: concurrency

  * lru queue

  * walking over linked list and trees
  * maps for memoization
